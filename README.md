# Calculator
## Description
This project creates a calculator for the user to use. The goal of this project was mainly to practice my web development skills and demonstrate a basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JS. Problems related to properly implementing flexbox without warping the appearance of the application and taking keyboard input from the user are some issues I ran into while building this application. Solving these issues has helped me further develop my skills in website development and has further developed my understanding of the event object. Another big lesson is the importance of naming variables with concise names and the issues with having too many global variables. I can see how it is confusing to keep track of too many global variables that need to be called in multiple different events/functions and how easy it is to forget what each one does after being away from the code for a few days.

Further work by myself on this project will likely be non-existent or limited as I have completed the initial goals I set out to accomplish.
